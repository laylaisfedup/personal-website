    <div class="Goal">
      <p> The goal for this part of my website is to have an itemized list of my current library. One of my life goals is having a home where the library is the main attraction. I love collecting books from a wide array of topics. I think it keeps one humble. I'm also a huge fan of Umberto Eco's concept of the antilibrary - a collection of unread books one keeps or collects. The list will not be divided into neat little categorizatios. I find that boring. Instead I'll highlight which books I think made a strong impression on me and therefore recommend to others.</p>
