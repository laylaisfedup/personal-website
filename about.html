    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>I'm Habibah Ibrahim, a current Public Service masters student based in Waterloo, Canada.</p>
      
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> I'm orginally from Somalia and have spent the bulk of my life in Canada. I've also lived in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria. I consider this period of my life core to my current journey into public policy and why i'm a strong believer in a borderless world and humanism at large.</p>
      <h2> Currently </h2>
      <p> I'm currently engaged in finishing my final study term at the University of Waterloo and prepping for coop jobs during the spring. I spend most of my time thinking about my inner world, failing (alot!), and trying to show up for myself. </p>
      
      <h2>Previously</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong> Policy Researcher, CanAfro Research Institute</strong> (2025) - Helped with writing three policy research papers that examined: how Black people are depicted in textbooks in Canada, the mental health of East African youth in the KW region, and contextuating the history of Black Canadians in Southern Ontario.</li>
        <li><strong> OC Transpo. </strong> (2019-2022) - Worked in a variety of roles here including being an essential worker during the pandemic and being a train conductor for the then newly opened trains.  </li>
        <li><strong> Tim Hortons, Boys & Girls Club, etc. </strong> (2015-2018) - Worked a variety of people facing jobs that taught me a lot about grit, self-compassion, and managing priorities. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>Beyond work, I'm interested in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Languages. I speak Somali, Arabic, and Turkish with relative fluency. </li>
        <li> Books. I'm currently building my antilibrary and love collecting books from Africa and the Middle East. I'm always reading 3-5 books simulataneously and famously only finish one if I can. </li>
        <li> Myself. I believe it is our moral duty to learn about who we are and work to realize whatever life we want and goals we have. Even if it is just learning how to be kind to oneself. </li>
      </ul>
