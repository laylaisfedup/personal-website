    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>I'm Habibah Ibrahim, a current masters student based in Waterloo, Canada.</p>
      
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I'm originally from Somalia and have spent the bulk of my life in Canada. I'm a fan of sci-fi, tech, and public policy (thus being a masters student in Public Service!) </p>
      
      <h2>Currently</h2>
      <p>I'm currently engaged in finishing my final study term and getting ready for potential coops.I spend most of my time thinking about my inner world, failing (a lot!), and trying to show up for myself.  What occupies most of your time and attention?</p>
      
      <h2>Previously</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Role/Organization</strong> (2020-2023) - What you did and its impact</li>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>Beyond work, I'm interested in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Languages. I speak Somali, Arabic, and Turkish with relative fluency. </li>
        <li> Books. I'm currently building my antilibrary and love collecting books from Africa and the Middle East. I'm always reading 3-5 books simulataneously and famously only finish one if I can. </li>
        <li>Interest three</li>
      </ul>
